# PivotControls

This code snippet utilizes the PivotControls component from @react-three/drei library in a React application.

The PivotControls component is used to manipulate the position and rotation of objects in a 3D scene. 

In this example, the PivotControls component is rendered with specific configurations, such as setting the anchor point, disabling depth testing, defining axis colors, and adjusting line width.

Additionally, a mesh is included within the PivotControls component to demonstrate its functionality.
